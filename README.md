# Whatsapp-Text-Processing-With-Python

This is a very simple Whatsapp text processing project that encapsulates the use of basic Python methods to convert it into a Pandas dataframe for further analysis.

We will be covering the following in this project:

1. 2 libraries (pandas for dataframe and datetime to detect datetime objects)
2. A lot ofÂ .split() methods
3. List comprehensions
4. Error-handling

We will not be using Python's regex library for simplicity.
